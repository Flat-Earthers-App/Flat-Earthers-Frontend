# FE Frontend - NASA Space Challenge
This repository contains the frontend code for the NASA Space Challenge project, built using React.js to deliver a dynamic, responsive user interface.

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. The backend must also be running simultaneously, as the frontend relies on several API calls to interact with it.



##  Running the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**  
Before starting the project, install the required dependencies by running:
```
npm i
```

2. **Start Development Server**  
To run the project in development mode, use:


```
npm run dev
```
Make sure the backend is running to enable proper functionality of the API calls.



## Features
The following features are available to both registered and anonymous users, except for the Landsat notifications, which are limited to registered users. These notifications inform users when a Landsat satellite passes over a specified target.
